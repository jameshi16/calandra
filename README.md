# UCL API Hackathon 2022 - Calandra

Made to make sure nothing is missed in your UCL's journey...

UCL has many events from a variety of sources, including [the student union](),
[departmental events](), and student's own personal timetable.

It gets difficult to keep track of all the events, especially for one who wishes
to make full use of their time in UCL. Hence, we developed Calandra, a
one-stop calendar for all things UCL.

Please read the respective `README.md` in the sub-directories to know how to
host them.
